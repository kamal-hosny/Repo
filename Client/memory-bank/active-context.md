- **Backend Dependency**: APIs and socket endpoint provided by Express.js team

### üìä User Role Hierarchy
```
Super Admin (University-wide)
    ‚Üì
Admin (College/Department level)
    ‚Üì
Teacher (Course level)
    ‚Üì
Student (Individual level)
```

### üõ£Ô∏è Key Route Structure
```
/ (Landing Page)
/login (Authentication)
/student/:id (Student Dashboard)
/teacher/:id (Teacher Dashboard)  
/admin/:id (Admin Dashboard)
/superadmin/:id (Super Admin Dashboard)
/students, /teachers, /admins (User Lists - Role-based access)
```

## Next Steps

### üèóÔ∏è Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 hours)
1. **Initialize Next.js Project**
   - Setup TypeScript configuration
   - Configure essential dependencies
   - Establish project folder structure
   
2. **Create Base Layout Components**
   - Authentication layout for login page
   - Dashboard layout for role-based pages
   - Public layout for landing page
   
3. **Implement Authentication Flow**
   - Login page with credential validation
   - JWT token handling and storage
   - Role-based redirection logic
   
4. **Setup Theme and Language Systems**
   - Theme provider with dark/light mode
   - Language provider with AR/EN support
   - Local storage persistence implementation

### üéØ Week 1 Goals
- Complete project setup and basic architecture
- Implement authentication system with role routing
- Create basic dashboard layouts for all user types
- Setup theme and language switching functionality
- Establish API integration patterns

### üéØ Week 2 Goals
- Implement core dashboard features for each role
- Create assignment management system
- Integrate real-time notification system
- Implement file upload and management
- Add responsive design optimization

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### üö® Technical Challenges
1. **RTL/LTR Layout Complexity**
   - **Challenge**: Seamless layout direction switching
   - **Solution**: CSS-in-JS with direction-aware styling

2. **Real-time Socket Integration**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining socket connection across route changes
   - **Solution**: Context-based socket provider with connection management

3. **Role-based Access Control**
   - **Challenge**: Complex permission system across multiple roles
   - **Solution**: Hierarchical role guard components with permission matrices

4. **File Upload at Scale**
   - **Challenge**: Handling large files and concurrent uploads
   - **Solution**: Chunked upload with progress tracking and error recovery

### üé® Design Challenges
1. **Multi-language Design Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining design integrity across AR/EN
   - **Solution**: Design system with language-agnostic components

2. **Theme Consistency**
