🔄 admin.tsx (Updating to unified pattern)
📋 superadmin.tsx (Planned)
✅ _app.tsx (Optimal provider hierarchy)
```

### Routing Flow Status

```
✅ Public Access (Landing page accessible to all)
✅ Authentication Check (Protected route validation)
✅ Preference Restoration (Theme + language from localStorage)
🔄 Global Router Logic (Role-based routing decisions)
✅ Unified Page Access (All roles access same pages)
✅ Content Control (Role-based content visibility)
```

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

### 1. Unified vs Separate Pages

- **Decision**: All roles access same pages with role-based content control
- **Rationale**: Eliminates duplicate code, easier maintenance, consistent UX
- **Implementation**: Pages use RoleGuard components for content control

### 2. Provider Hierarchy Order

- **Decision**: Redux → Hydration → Theme → Language → ProtectedRoute → GlobalRouter
- **Rationale**: Each layer builds on previous, optimal dependency flow
- **Implementation**: Ensures preferences persist across sessions

### 3. Protected Route Scope

- **Decision**: Only handle authentication + localStorage preferences
- **Rationale**: Single responsibility, better separation of concerns
- **Implementation**: GlobalRouter handles all routing logic separately

### 4. Future Real-time Strategy

- **Decision**: Socket.io integration after foundation completion
- **Rationale**: Build solid foundation first, add real-time features later
- **Implementation**: Provider structure ready for socket integration

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Admin Page**: Finish unified admin.tsx implementation
2. **Create SuperAdmin Page**: Implement superadmin.tsx following patterns
3. **Test Complete Flow**: Verify authentication → routing → content flow
4. **Validate Persistence**: Ensure theme/language preferences work correctly
5. **Update Remaining Docs**: Complete memory bank file updates
