# Project Overview - Task-Flow LMS Frontend

## Project Vision

### Unified Learning Management System

Task-Flow LMS is a modern, role-based learning management system built with a unified router architecture. All users access the same pages, with content and functionality dynamically controlled based on their role and permissions.

### Core Principles

- **Unified Access**: Single router serving all user roles
- **Role-Based Content Control**: Dynamic content visibility based on user permissions
- **Foundation-First Approach**: Building robust infrastructure before feature implementation
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Designed for real-time collaboration and advanced features

## Current Architecture

### Unified Router System

```
User Request â†’ Authentication â†’ Preference Loading â†’ Global Router â†’ Unified Page â†’ Role-Based Content
```

### Provider Hierarchy

```typescript
<ReduxProvider>
  {" "}
  // State management foundation
  <ClientHydration>
    {" "}
    // SSR/CSR compatibility
    <ThemeProvider>
      {" "}
      // UI theming + persistence
      <LanguageProvider>
        {" "}
        // Internationalization + persistence
        <ProtectedRoute>
          {" "}
          // Authentication + preference restoration
          <GlobalRouter>
            {" "}
            // Unified routing logic
            <Component /> // Role-based content control
          </GlobalRouter>
        </ProtectedRoute>
      </LanguageProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </ClientHydration>
</ReduxProvider>
```

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management

### Core Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication

## User Roles & Unified Access

### Role Structure

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  STUDENT = "STUDENT",
  TEACHER = "TEACHER",
  ADMIN = "ADMIN",
  SUPER_ADMIN = "SUPER_ADMIN",
}
```

### Unified Page Access

All roles can access the same pages:

- **Student Portal** (`/student`): All roles see relevant content
- **Teacher Portal** (`/teacher`): All roles see appropriate view
- **Admin Portal** (`/admin`): All roles see permitted sections
- **SuperAdmin Portal** (`/superadmin`): All roles see authorized content

### Content Control Pattern

```typescript
// Example: Student page accessible to all, content varies
const StudentPage = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Student Portal</h1>

      {/* All users see basic info */}
      <StudentOverview />

      {/* Role-specific content */}
      <RoleGuard allowedRoles={["STUDENT"]}>
        <StudentDashboard />
      </RoleGuard>

      <RoleGuard allowedRoles={["TEACHER"]}>
        <TeacherStudentView />
      </RoleGuard>

      <RoleGuard allowedRoles={["ADMIN", "SUPER_ADMIN"]}>
        <AdminStudentManagement />
      </RoleGuard>
    </div>
  );
};
```
